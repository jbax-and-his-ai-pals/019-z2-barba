# Build and validation

Requires Python 3.10+ and the ca65/ld65 programs from [cc65](https://cc65.github.io/).
Portable Windows tools may be placed in `.tools/cc65/bin/`. No Python packages
are required. All paths below are relative to the repository root.

Place your source ROM at `roms/z2.nes`. The build requires SHA-256:

```text
ad8c0fbcf092bf84b48e69fd3964eea4ed91bfe62abc352943d537979782680c
```

The build will reject other dumps rather than guessing where to patch them.
The original is opened read-only. Never copy a modified ROM over it.

Research graphics can be rendered with `python tools/inspect_chr.py`.
They stay in `build/` and must not be committed.

## Emulator checks

Put portable [Mesen 2.1.1](https://github.com/SourMesen/Mesen2/releases/tag/2.1.1)
at `.tools/mesen/Mesen.exe`. The headless runner uses a local configuration in
that folder; Lua file access is enabled for checked-in test scripts to write
screenshots and reports into `build/`. Networking remains disabled.

```powershell
python tools/emulator_test.py tests/boot.lua --rom roms/z2.nes
```

The runner saves screenshots and logs locally. It does not open a GUI.
Emulator scenario coverage is documented separately from full-playthrough status.
